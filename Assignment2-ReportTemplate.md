# 1 Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to intorduce us to the concepts of automated unit testing. In this lab we will be tasked with creating unit test using the primary testing tool in Java, being the JUnit framework. We will be using the JUnit framework, to test the system JFreeChart. In order to test the system, units tests will be created based in requirements found in the Javadocs for the JFreeChart software. Certain aspects of the JFreeChart system that we will be testing, will require the development and use of mock objects in order to simulate features of objects that are hard to reproduce in our unit tests.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

// including the input partitions you have designed

# 3 Test cases developed

// write down the name of the test methods and classes. Organize the based on
the source code method // they test. identify which tests cover which partitions
you have explained in the test strategy section //above
