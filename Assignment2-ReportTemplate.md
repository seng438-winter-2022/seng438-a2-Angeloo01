# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

// including the input partitions you have designed
Our strategy for this assignment is to use Black-box testing, weak equivalence class testing, boundary value testing, and weak robustness testing. We are undergoing black-box testing because we do not know the internal structure and the implementation of the functions and classes we are testing. Additionally, we chose to undego weak ECT because of the limited time frame and strong ECT introduces some redundancy. We chose to do BVT and weak robustness testing so that we can test the behaviour at the boundary values and out of bound values in addition to correctness of output.

To apply these testing methods, we are going to implement unit tests using JUnit 4. Additionally, to test functions that rely on DOC's we will use Jmock to create stubs and/or mocks to act as fakes. In addition, these stubs and mocks will allow us to verify the state of the SUT, and its behaviour and interactions during the test.
